A comprehensive web-based platform designed to connect students with tutors, using a suite of technologies including XAMPP, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, jQuery, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and AdminLTE. The system is structured into three key components: a Public Site for browsing and searching for tutors, a Tutor Site for managing profiles and availability, and an Admin Panel for overseeing and administrating the platform. This project streamlines the process of finding and managing tutoring services, offering a seamless and efficient user experience for students, tutors, and administrators alike.
